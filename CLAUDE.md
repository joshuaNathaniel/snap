# Snap -- Project Context for Claude Code

## What this is

A two-component system: a Tauri 2.x desktop app (Rust + vanilla JS) for screen annotation, and a Python MCP server that exposes the annotation inbox to coding agents.

## Architecture

- `app/` -- Tauri 2.x project. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend, no framework. Rust backend handles screen capture, window context, and file I/O.
- `mcp-server/` -- Python package using `fastmcp`. Stdio transport. Reads from `~/.snap/inbox/` (`SNAP_DATA_DIR` moves it).

## Key decisions

- Vanilla JS for the overlay frontend. No React, no build tooling beyond what Tauri provides.
- Screen capture on Wayland goes through the XDG desktop portal first (`org.freedesktop.portal.Screenshot` over D-Bus via `gio`). GNOME 50 stopped letting `gnome-screenshot` capture, so the portal is the only silent route there. Fallbacks run as subprocesses with a 10s timeout: `gnome-screenshot` (older GNOME), `grim` (wlroots), `scrot` (X11). Tries each in order, uses the first that works.
- Window context uses `xdotool` on X11, and `xprop` for the class where xdotool has no `getwindowclassname` (Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04). Returns None on Wayland.
- Annotations stored as PNG + sidecar JSON pairs in `~/.snap/inbox/`.
- MCP server is read-only. It never writes annotations, only reads and deletes.
- On Wayland: app runs in single-shot overlay mode, triggered by GNOME custom keybinding via `snap-trigger.sh`.
- On X11, macOS and Windows: app runs as a persistent tray app with built-in global hotkey via Tauri's global-shortcut plugin. On macOS it is an accessory app (no Dock icon) until its overlay opens.

## Conventions

- Tauri commands use snake_case
- JS annotation objects match the sidecar JSON schema
- All file paths use `~/.snap/` as the root, or `SNAP_DATA_DIR` (made absolute) for both the app and the MCP server
- Error handling: never crash silently, always log to `~/.snap/snap.log`
- Log rotation at 1MB for both Rust and Python
- Git commits: short, direct messages

## Build

```bash
make build          # Build everything
make dev            # Run in dev mode
npx tauri build     # Rebuild Tauri app only (must use this, not cargo build alone)
```

## Test

```bash
node --test app/src/export-scale.test.mjs
cd mcp-server && .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Layout

- Releases: pushing a `v*.*.*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds Linux, macOS (arm64 + x86_64), and Windows and attaches the files to a GitHub release. `install.sh` downloads those assets by name (`snap-linux-x86_64`, `snap-macos-<arch>.zip`); keep the names in sync.
- Root scripts (`install.sh`, `snap-trigger.sh`, `install-hotkey.sh`, `setup-mcp.sh`, `snap-doctor.sh`) resolve the repo from their own location and are referenced by absolute path from users' hotkey and MCP configs. Do not move them.

Important: Always use `npx tauri build` or `make build`, never bare `cargo build`. The Tauri build embeds the frontend files into the binary. `cargo build` alone produces a binary with no frontend.
