# Snap Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions to build, install, and configure Snap on Linux. For macOS and Windows, see the [README](README.md#macos-quick-install); the [Register the MCP Server](#register-the-mcp-server) section below applies to every platform.

The short version is the one-line installer in the [README](README.md#quick-start), or from a clone `make deps && make install && ./setup-mcp.sh`, then `./snap-doctor.sh` to check the result. The rest of this guide explains each step and how to do it by hand.

## Prerequisites

### Required

| Dependency | Purpose | Install |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Rust toolchain | Builds the Tauri app | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` |
| Node.js 18+ | Tauri CLI and frontend bundling | `nvm install 20` or [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Python 3.11+ | MCP server runtime | Usually pre-installed on Ubuntu 22.04+ |
| uv | Python package manager | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |

### System Libraries (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
  pkg-config \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  build-essential \
  libxdo-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev
```

### Screen Capture Tool

You need **one** of these, depending on your display server:

| Display Server | Tool | Install |
|---------------|------|---------|
| GNOME 50+ on Wayland (Ubuntu 26.04) | XDG desktop portal | preinstalled (`xdg-desktop-portal-gnome`) |
| Older GNOME on Wayland | `gnome-screenshot` | `sudo apt install gnome-screenshot` |
| wlroots Wayland (Sway, Hyprland) | `grim` | `sudo apt install grim` |
| X11 | `scrot` | `sudo apt install scrot` |

**How to check your display server:**
```bash
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
# "wayland" or "x11"
```

Snap tries capture tools in order of preference and uses the first one that works. Install multiple if you switch between display servers.

### Window Context (Optional, X11 only)

```bash
sudo apt install xdotool x11-utils
```

This captures the active window title, class, and PID when you trigger Snap. `xprop` (x11-utils) reads the class where xdotool cannot (Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 ship an xdotool without `getwindowclassname`). On Wayland, window context is not available (GNOME doesn't expose it to external tools). The sidecar JSON will have `null` for these fields on Wayland — annotations still work fine, the agent just won't know which window you were looking at.

---

## Build

### 1. Build the Tauri App

```bash
cd app
npm install
npx tauri build
```

This produces a release binary at:
```
app/src-tauri/target/release/snap
```

Build takes ~60-90 seconds on first run (compiling ~500 Rust crates). Subsequent rebuilds are ~20 seconds.

### 2. Install the MCP Server

```bash
cd mcp-server
uv venv .venv
uv pip install -e .
```

### 3. Verify Both Components

```bash
# Check the binary exists
ls -lh app/src-tauri/target/release/snap

# Check the MCP server loads
mcp-server/.venv/bin/python -c "from server import mcp; print('MCP server OK')"
```

Or use the Makefile:
```bash
make build
```

---

## Configure the Global Hotkey

### GNOME on Wayland (Ubuntu 22.04+, default)

Tauri's global shortcut plugin doesn't work on Wayland. Instead, GNOME handles the hotkey and runs a trigger script.

**1. Register the keybinding:**
```bash
make hotkey          # or: ./install-hotkey.sh
```

This makes `snap-trigger.sh` executable and adds a GNOME custom keybinding for `Ctrl+Shift+S` that runs it. Your existing custom shortcuts are left alone. (`make install` does this for you on a Wayland session.)

**2. Test it:**

Press `Ctrl+Shift+S`. The overlay should appear with a screenshot of your desktop.

**To change the hotkey**, pass a GTK accelerator:
```bash
SNAP_HOTKEY='<Super><Shift>s' make hotkey    # Windows key + Shift + S
SNAP_HOTKEY='<Control><Shift>x' make hotkey  # Ctrl + Shift + X
```

**To remove the keybinding:**
```bash
./install-hotkey.sh --remove
```

### X11

On X11, Snap runs as a background tray app with a built-in global hotkey. No GNOME keybinding needed.

```bash
# Install and enable the systemd service
make install
```

Or manually:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp snap.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable snap.service
systemctl --user start snap.service
```

The app starts silently in the system tray. Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` to trigger the overlay.

**Service management:**
```bash
make start     # Start the service
make stop      # Stop the service
make restart   # Restart after rebuild
make status    # Check if running
make logs      # Tail the systemd journal
```

### Other Wayland Compositors (Sway, Hyprland, etc.)

Bind `Ctrl+Shift+S` to the trigger script in your compositor config:

**Sway** (`~/.config/sway/config`):
```
bindsym Ctrl+Shift+s exec ~/Desktop/snap/snap-trigger.sh
```

**Hyprland** (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`):
```
bind = CTRL SHIFT, S, exec, ~/Desktop/snap/snap-trigger.sh
```

Replace `~/Desktop/snap` with wherever you cloned the repo; `make hotkey` prints these lines with the right path.

---

## Register the MCP Server

### Automatic Setup (Recommended)

The setup script detects which AI tools you have installed and registers Snap with all of them:

```bash
./setup-mcp.sh
```

Output looks like:
```
Snap MCP Setup
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ MCP server verified

Detecting installed tools...

✓ Claude Code — registered
✓ Claude Desktop — configured at ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
✓ Cursor — configured at ~/.cursor/mcp.json
⊘ Windsurf — not installed, skipping
```

It auto-detects and configures: **Claude Code**, **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, and **Windsurf**. Tools that aren't installed are skipped.

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to register manually, or use a tool the script doesn't cover:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio snap -- \
  $HOME/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python \
  $HOME/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/server.py
```

**Claude Desktop** — add to `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Linux) or `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "snap": {
      "command": "/home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "snap": {
      "command": "/home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Windsurf** — add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "snap": {
      "command": "/home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["/home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code + Cline** — add to Cline's MCP settings in the extension config:
```json
{
  "snap": {
    "command": "/home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python",
    "args": ["/home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/server.py"]
  }
}
```

**Any other MCP client** — the two values you need:
```
command: /home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python
args:    /home/YOU/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/server.py
```

Replace `/home/YOU/Desktop/snap` with wherever you cloned the repo.

### Verify

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp list
# Should show: snap: ... - ✓ Connected
```

### Test It

1. Take a snap annotation (`Ctrl+Shift+S` → draw → Enter)
2. Open any registered agent
3. Say: "check my latest snap annotation"
4. The agent calls `get_latest_annotation()`, reads the image, and sees what you marked

---

## Add Snap Awareness to CLAUDE.md

Add this to your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so Claude Code automatically checks for annotations:

```markdown
## Snap — Visual Annotations

You have access to the `snap` MCP tools for reading annotated screenshots.

### Tools:
- `check_new_annotations()` — call at the start of every task to see if there's visual feedback
- `get_latest_annotation()` — returns the most recent annotated screenshot (attached as an image) + metadata
- `list_annotations(last_n)` — returns recent annotations (pass `include_image=true` to attach the screenshots)
- `get_annotation(filename)` — returns a specific annotation
- `clear_inbox()` — deletes processed annotations

### When to use:
- At the START of any UI/frontend task, call `check_new_annotations()` first
- If the user says "look at my annotation" or "check my snap", call `get_latest_annotation()`
- Look at the attached screenshot; if no image came back, READ THE IMAGE at `image_path`
- Annotation coordinates in the metadata are pixels of that image
- Use `source.window_title` to infer which page/component the user was looking at

### How to interpret:
- Red circles/rectangles = "this area has a problem"
- Arrows = "this should move/connect there"
- Text labels = literal instructions ("fix this", "16px gap", "wrong color")
- Numbered markers = ordered list of issues (fix #1 first, then #2, etc.)
- Freehand marks = emphasis, "look at this general area"
```

For project-specific CLAUDE.md files, add a shorter pointer:

```markdown
## Visual Feedback
This project uses Snap for visual annotations. Call `check_new_annotations()` at the start of UI tasks.
```

## File Locations

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.snap/inbox/` | Annotated screenshots + sidecar JSON |
| `~/.snap/snap.log` | Event log (auto-rotates at 1MB, one backup at `snap.log.old`) |
| `~/.snap/.last_read` | MCP server's read cursor (tracks which annotations are "new") |
| `~/.snap/snap-tray.lock` | Keeps a second tray app from starting (tray mode only) |

`SNAP_DATA_DIR` moves all of these to another folder; the app and the MCP server both read it.
| `/tmp/snap-capture.png` | Temporary screen capture (in `$TMPDIR` if set; overwritten each time) |
| `/tmp/snap-overlay.lock` | Lock file preventing concurrent overlays (Wayland trigger script) |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Screen capture failed" error on overlay

**Cause:** No screenshot tool installed, or the installed tool doesn't work with your display server.

**Fix:** Install the right tool for your display server (see Prerequisites above). `./snap-doctor.sh` tests the capture path end to end, including the desktop portal. To test a tool manually:
```bash
# GNOME Wayland before GNOME 50 (on 50+ this hangs; the app uses the portal)
gnome-screenshot --file=/tmp/test.png && echo "OK"

# wlroots Wayland
grim /tmp/test.png && echo "OK"

# X11
scrot /tmp/test.png && echo "OK"
```

### Hotkey doesn't do anything (Wayland)

**Cause:** GNOME custom keybinding not registered, or `snap-trigger.sh` isn't executable.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check the keybinding is registered
gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys custom-keybindings

# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x snap-trigger.sh

# Check the log for trigger events
tail ~/.snap/snap.log
```

### Overlay appears but annotations don't save

**Cause:** The `Enter` key or save button isn't connected, or the inbox directory isn't writable.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check the inbox directory exists and is writable
ls -la ~/.snap/inbox/

# Check the log for save events
grep "Saved annotation" ~/.snap/snap.log

# Try clicking the green checkmark button instead of pressing Enter
```

### Not sure what is wrong

```bash
./snap-doctor.sh
```

It checks the build, takes a silent test capture with the right tool for your session, prints what GDK reports for your monitors, and verifies the hotkey and MCP registration.

### Screenshot appears zoomed in, tiny in the corner, or offset

**Cause:** the overlay window is not the size of the screen, or the display scale is not what the app was told.

**Fix:** press the hotkey once, then look at the last lines of `~/.snap/snap.log`. The app logs the monitor size and scale it was given, the window size it created, and what the page saw:

```
monitor Some("LG HDR 4K"): 7680x4320 physical, scale 2
sizing overlay to monitor: 3840x2160 logical
[ui] after show: viewport 1920x1080 dpr=2 screen=3840x2160 capture=3840x2160 draw=1920x1080@0,0
```

`viewport` should be your screen's logical size, `capture` its physical size, and `draw` should equal the viewport at `@0,0` for a single monitor. (GNOME's GDK reports the monitor in physical pixels, hence the doubled "physical" line; the compositor clamps the window, so this is harmless.) If they disagree, open an issue with those lines.

### MCP server not connected

**Fix:**
```bash
# Re-register
claude mcp remove snap
claude mcp add --transport stdio snap -- \
  $HOME/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/.venv/bin/python \
  $HOME/Desktop/snap/mcp-server/server.py

# Verify
claude mcp list
```

### Overlay window doesn't close after save

**Cause:** The process might be stuck.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Kill it
kill $(pgrep -f "target/release/snap")
rm -f /tmp/snap-overlay.lock
```

### Log file growing too large

Won't happen — both the Rust app and MCP server auto-rotate `~/.snap/snap.log` at 1MB, keeping one backup at `snap.log.old`.
